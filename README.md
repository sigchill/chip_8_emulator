# chip_8_emulator
## This is a chip-8 emulator in the building

about me : im interested in low level stuff, revrse engineering, pwn, systems in general
so to strengthen my programming skills i though i'd build a chip-8 emulaotr which is considered by most a very feasible feat for a single person

resources i  use : http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM (the manual for commands)
                    https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/ (this is great its language agonstic you just need to read the logic, it's about chip-8 not how to build it)
